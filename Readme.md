STANDARD CELL DESIGN AND WITH OPENLANE DESIGN
Standard cell design involves creating a library of predefined logic cells (such as AND, OR, and flip-flops) with consistent height and varying widths to be used in digital circuits. These cells are then arranged in rows and interconnected to form larger circuits.

OpenLane is an open-source automated VLSI design flow for physical design implementation, from RTL to GDSII, optimized for use with open-source PDKs like Sky130.
